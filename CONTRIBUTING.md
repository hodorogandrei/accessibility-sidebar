```

## üìù Code Standards

### JavaScript/React Standards

- **ES6+**: Use modern JavaScript features
- **React Hooks**: Prefer functional components with hooks
- **JSX**: Follow React best practices for component structure
- **Props**: Use TypeScript-style prop validation when possible

### Code Style

```javascript
// Use descriptive variable names
const isHighContrastEnabled = settings.highContrast;

// Prefer const/let over var
const accessibilitySettings = {
  fontSize: 'normal',
  contrast: false,
  lineHeight: 1.5
};

// Use template literals for strings
const ariaLabel = `Font size: ${currentSize}, click to ${action}`;

// Comment complex accessibility logic
// Ensure screen readers announce state changes
announceToScreenReader(message);
```

### File Organization

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/          # Reusable React components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/              # Utility functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/              # Custom React hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/             # CSS and styling
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ accessibility/      # Accessibility-specific utilities
```

## ‚ôø Accessibility Guidelines

### WCAG Compliance

All contributions must maintain **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance**:

- **Perceivable**: Content must be presentable in ways users can perceive
- **Operable**: Interface components must be operable by all users
- **Understandable**: Information and UI operation must be understandable
- **Robust**: Content must be robust enough for various assistive technologies

### Accessibility Checklist

Before submitting code, verify:

- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- [ ] **Color Contrast**: Meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text)
- [ ] **Focus Indicators**: Clear visual focus indicators for all interactive elements
- [ ] **Alternative Text**: Images have meaningful alt attributes
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Accessible error messages and form validation
- [ ] **State Communication**: State changes are announced to assistive technologies

### Testing with Assistive Technologies

Test your changes with:
- **Keyboard only** navigation (unplug your mouse)
- **Screen readers** (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- **Voice control** software
- **High contrast** mode
- **Browser zoom** up to 200%

### Semantic HTML

```html
<!-- Good: Semantic button -->
<button aria-label="Increase font size" onClick={increaseFontSize}>
  A+
</button>

<!-- Bad: Non-semantic div -->
<div className="button" onClick={increaseFontSize}>
  A+
</div>
```

### ARIA Best Practices

```javascript
// Use ARIA attributes appropriately
<div 
  role="slider"
  aria-label="Font size"
  aria-valuemin="1"
  aria-valuemax="3"
  aria-valuenow={currentSize}
  tabIndex="0"
/>

// Announce dynamic changes
const announceChange = (message) => {
  const announcement = document.createElement('div');
  announcement.setAttribute('aria-live', 'polite');
  announcement.textContent = message;
  document.body.appendChild(announcement);
  setTimeout(() => document.body.removeChild(announcement), 1000);
};
```

## üß™ Testing

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Component Structure

```javascript
// AccessibleComponent.jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

const AccessibleComponent = ({ 
  onValueChange, 
  initialValue = 'default',
  ariaLabel 
}) => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);
  const componentRef = useRef(null);

  // Focus management
  useEffect(() => {
    if (componentRef.current) {
      componentRef.current.focus();
    }
  }, []);

  // Announce changes to screen readers
  const handleValueChange = (newValue) => {
    setValue(newValue);
    onValueChange?.(newValue);
    
    // Announce change
    announceToScreenReader(`Value changed to ${newValue}`);
  };

  return (
    <div
      ref={componentRef}
      role="slider"
      aria-label={ariaLabel}
      aria-valuenow={value}
      tabIndex={0}
      onKeyDown={handleKeyboardInteraction}
      onClick={handleClick}
    >
      {/* Component content */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default AccessibleComponent;
```

### State Management

- Use React hooks for local state
- Implement proper state announcements for screen readers
- Persist accessibility settings in localStorage
- Provide state restoration capabilities

### Performance Considerations

- Minimize bundle size impact
- Use lazy loading for optional features
- Optimize for slow networks and older devices
- Implement smooth animations with proper motion preferences

## üåç Internationalization

### Language Support

- **Primary**: English
- **Secondary**: Romanian (reflecting the project's advocacy focus)
- **Future**: Additional languages based on community needs

### Text Externalization

```javascript
// Use consistent text externalization
const messages = {
  en: {
    increaseFontSize: 'Increase font size',
    decreaseFontSize: 'Decrease font size',
    toggleContrast: 'Toggle high contrast mode'
  },
  ro: {
    increaseFontSize: 'MƒÉre»ôte dimensiunea fontului',
    decreaseFontSize: 'Mic»ôoreazƒÉ dimensiunea fontului',
    toggleContrast: 'ComutƒÉ modul de contrast ridicat'
  }
};
```
